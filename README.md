## Describe your project in detail below

This a python program is designed to take input from a user and create a webpage using that input.
Create-webpage.py asks the user to give a name for the .html file, simple questions about a character, a path to an image of the character. This data is consolidated into a variable which is read to a head.txt and a footer.txt file. This is consolidated again into variable to which is the code for a html file. The program opens and writes the data into a out_file. That file is the final output where the webpage is ran.
